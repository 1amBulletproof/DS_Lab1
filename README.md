# DS_Lab1
Thanks for using Brandon Tarney's Lab 1 program. 

The source code in this assignment can be compiled with Java 1.8 from the command line.

To run the program, enter:  java Lab1 [inputFile] [outputfile].

My 5th language checks for the presence of ONLY vowels, in the order/precedence 
"AEIOU". "AO", "EI", "O", "" are examples of strings which match with language 5. 
"UO", "IA", "BOON IS THE BEST" are examples of strings which DO NOT match language 5.

My 6th language checks the entire input string for a palindrome.
